The silver layer of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is the intermediate stage where raw data from the bronze layer is cleaned, enriched, and transformed into a more structured format. This layer focuses on data quality and consistency, ensuring that the data is accurate, complete, and ready for further analysis or loading into the gold layer. Common tasks in the silver layer include data validation, deduplication, normalization, and applying business logic to create meaningful datasets.
