The bronze layer in an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) architecture is the initial landing zone for raw data ingested from various source systems. It stores data in its original, unprocessed form, preserving all details and history. This layer acts as a single source of truth for subsequent processing, enabling traceability and reprocessing if needed. The bronze layer contains data with minimal or no transformation, serving as the foundation for building more refined datasets in the silver and gold layers.
